âœ… Dark/Light Mode Toggle  
âœ… Select Different Songs  
âœ… Volume Control  
âœ… Animated Music Notes ðŸŽµ  
âœ… **Headphone Icon with Pulse Effect ðŸŽ§**  

This music website allows users to enjoy background music while browsing.  
It features a dark/light mode toggle, which changes the website theme between dark (ðŸŒ™) and light (ðŸŒž).  
A notification informs users to click anywhere to enable music playback if autoplay is blocked.  
Users can select from multiple songs using a dropdown menu.  
The play, pause, and volume controls allow better audio management, with the volume adjustable between 0 and 1.  
The site remembers the last selected theme using localStorage, ensuring the same appearance when reopened.  

### ðŸŽ§ **Headphone Icon with Pulse Effect**
A **headphone emoji (ðŸŽ§) with a glowing circular pulse effect** is added below the controls.  
- When the music **plays**, the circle **pulsates** to indicate active playback.  
- When the music **pauses**, the effect stops.  

Additionally, floating music note animations ðŸŽµ enhance the experience, while the emojis in the text animate with a bouncing effect.  
The biggest challenge was storing the theme preference and ensuring smooth playback functionality.  
The website is fully interactive and provides a seamless music experience with user-friendly controls. ðŸŽ¶âœ¨
